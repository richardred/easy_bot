# easy_bot

This Discord bot began as a joke, but eventually snowballed into the larger project that it is now.
It creates a friendly, interactive chat experience for a Discord server's users by doing basic things like sending and reacting
with emojis, supports role-dependent commands, and also has more advanced functionalities, such as displaying information 
about a user's most recent DotA 2 match and giving a brief weather forecast of a given city.
